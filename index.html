    <h1>The Deli Techno-Bible</h1>
    <p>
      Catalog of most of the things found in or done by the Deli Dept. The goal
      of this is not only to practice my web-development, but to help
      standardize the daily procedures around the deli. We, as a team, should
      strive to maintain a clean food-safe dept. Along with prioritizing
      proficient customer service. As the final form of the deli bible, its
      target is to make it as easy as possible.
